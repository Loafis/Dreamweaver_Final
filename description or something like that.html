          <p>We offer plush axes to maybe deter unwanted creatures from your fortress in a realtively humane way. We offer them in a variety of colors and different fabrics. They are all made by hand by my grandma and she makes them with lots of love and cheap fabrics. We can put scent sacks in the axes too if it is wanted, for some reason. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-panel" id="tab-2">
            <p>So for most of the asxes we use real polyester and cotton that we locally resource our fabrics from the Joanne's across the street from my house. Please let us know if you need an axe in a hypoallergenic fabric ahead of time so we can ask the nice people at the store. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-panel" id="tab-3">
            <p>All orders will be shipped at some point after my mom picks me up from soccer practice. She also said that I can say that we do free shipping on orders of $50 or more. </p>
